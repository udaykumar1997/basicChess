Vitfit\n1285 - Yes, I was writing about how acqua di roma should be in second place\n1286 - My analysis of the market showed high potential for Electric Grape. They are in demand as they have become a huge trend, and its production is very easy.\n1287 - was still processing the rest\n1288 - I agree!\n1289 - Teasies would also be saving on production as they will be using existing plants\n1290 - Electric Grape�estimates that it will generate 1.5 Euro profit per bottle, and market research shows that young adults love the idea of an energy drink that is less sweet than others.\n1291 - Yes, I think teases should be number 2\n1292 - and with the new Acqua di Roma information, I would move it to number 4\n1293 - i agree\n1294 - If the formula isnt finish then Vitfil should be number 5\n1295 - Placing Lemon Iced Tea second\n1296 - I agree\n1297 - yeah, me too\n1298 - so the official ranking would be 1)Electric Grape 2) Lemonade Iced Tea 3)BioBerry 4)Acqua di Roma 5)Vitfit ?\n"}
