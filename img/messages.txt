Because the flavors would be normal\n1628 - Whitey didn't sound very innovative to me but I read that it would be an innovative formula without chemicals, only soft granules for a mechanical effect\n1629 - Zen seems like a reasonable choice. There are few negative opinions of experts about it, the forecasts are rather promising. The only downside is the initial, one-off cost the company will have to tak\n1630 - Yes, Treasure Island sounded appealing to me because of the collecting part, I think kids would love it!\n1631 - Whitey sounds very good for first or second\n1632 - About Zen, my sheet says that the price of magnesium has gone down so they would save some money on that\n"}

When I was little, pictures of cars were collected from gum wrappers. The kids bought it without hesitation. Here, where you have to collect the entire map and exchange it for a toy, it may turn out to be a hit ... but on a short scale, because children who pick up their toys  won't be buying this rubber again\n1635 - Treasure sounds good, a safe decision. I feel that second or third would be a good choice.\n1636 - Maybe Zen first (safest choice, pretty similar to their previous product) and Treasure Island second?\n1637 - I don't recall reading any information about Business Class. Does anyone know anything about this?\n1638 - I propose: Zen, Treasure, Whitey, Cosmo, Bussines\n1639 - totally agree\n1640 - About Business Class I read that they have to run some further tests to prove the long lasting freshness effect\n1641 - Market research shows that the extra-long freshness effect of Business Class brings sales up to 150%of the expectation. But for this, the gums have to be sold with this claim; otherwise it will not se\n1642 - Shouldn't Cosmo go last since another company already patented?\n1643 - or swap whitey with cosmo. I can't decide\n1644 - I feel that long lasting doesn't make much sense to the vast majority of people anyway.\n1645 - But the jelly pearl thing would be done, wouldn't it?\n1646 - About Whitey, I think it depends on how well they manage to convey the idea that it's an innovative formula. If they do win the government innovation prize (mentioned on my sheet) it could be good\n1647 - whitey has a problem that it can hurt the gums, so the company will have to prepare for potential liability for damages\n1648 - I'm confused. Didn't we say we should exclude Cosmo because it's already patented?\n1649 - so maybe Zen, Treasure, Whitey, Business, Cosmo?\n1650 - I can agree. I still can find even what you copied about Business\n1651 - Seems good to me\n1652 - *still can't find\n"}
