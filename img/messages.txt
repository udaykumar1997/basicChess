It contains much less sugar than competitors' energy drinks but to be still energizing it must contain 200 mg of caffeine per 300 ml.-2:The production of Electric Grape is very easy and Teasies can use their existing plants for this.-3:Because recent studies have shown unhealthy effects of an energy drinks overdose, the government has decided to take legal steps against it. In a few weeks the sale of drinks with an amount of caffeine higher than 150 mg per 300 ml will be forbidden.-4:Market research shows that young adults love the idea of an energy drink that is not as sweet as others. Sales of Electric Grape would be 100% as expected.-5:The financial department has calculated that Electric Grape will generate 1.5 Euro profit per bottle. They expect 50 million bottles to be sold over 2 years.-6:The R&D department has developed a formula for BioBerry that completely replaces artificial ingredients with organic ones.-7:The organic ingredients needed for the production of BioBerry are very expensive and raise the selling price. At 3 Euro per bottle, it will be the most expensive lemonade on the market.-8:The government is very positive about 'green action' and supports companies producing all-organic products. The legal department found out that BioBerry would receive 15 million Euro of state funding if its ingredients are completely organic.-9:Market research shows that even though the general trend is against lemonade, organic lemonade would fill an important gap. BioBerry sales would be 100% as expected as long as the price is not higher than 3 Euro.-10:Because of expensive ingredients, the financial department estimates that BioBerry will generate only 1 Euro profit per bottle. They expect 50 million bottles to be sold over 2 years.-11:The R&D department has reviewed the original formula for Teasies' Lemon Iced Tea. The real key is the traditional brewing method. Nowadays no supplier uses it anymore, but Teasies' still has got the plant for it.-12:A safety inspection in Teasies' old brewing plant has revealed some deficits. If Teasies absolutely wants to stick to the traditional brewing method for the Teasies' Lemon Iced Tea, it has to reconstruct it which would cost additional 15 million Euro on top of the forecast.-13:According to current law, a product that wants to carry the label 'original' must be identical to the original one. For Teasies' Lemon Iced Tea that means that the formula has to be the same as the one used in the 80ies. Furthermore, the production method must be the exactly the same.-14:According to market research, the target group is very excited about a come-back of Teasies Lemon Iced Tea. If it has the label 'original', sales will be even 50% more than predicted. Without it, it will not sell at all.-15:The financial department has estimated that Teasies Lemon Iced Tea will make 1.25 Euro profit per bottle. They expect to sell 40 million bottles over 2 years.-16:The R&D department developed a very simple and cheap formula for Acqua di Roma: mineral water with a hint of fruit syrup. For 10 million bottles it only needs to process 25 000 liter syrup.-17:Because the contracts with the syrup suppliers are limited, Teasies' will only be able to source 100 000 liter of syrup for the production of Acqua di Roma in 2 years.-18:There is a legal conflict about the formula for Acqua di Roma because it is very similar to another product. To start production, Teasies has to settle this conflict. This would cause additional legal costs of 5 million Euro on top of the forecast.-19:Market research shows that the target group likes Acqua di Roma more than Teasies' management thought. Sales would be even 25% higher than initially expected.-20:The financial department expects to sell 50 million of bottles of Acqua di Roma over 2 years and to make 1.5 Euro profit per bottle.-21:The R&D department has a basic formula for Vitfit, but it has still to do some final tests to release it to the market. This would cost additional 5 million Euro on top of the forecast.-22:Some production space that is suitable for Vitfit has unexpectedly freed up. This would save Teasies 10 million Euro of rent costs they had calculated for Vitfit's production.-23:Vitfit's final formula is still not patented because there are some legal conflicts. To finalize the patent process, Teasies would need to pay additional 5 million Euro of legal fees on top of the forecast. The patent is necessary; otherwise Vitfit would be immediately copied by competitors and become unprofitable.-24:Market research shows that consumers are not very enthusiastic about Vitfit. It would sell okay, but only fulfill 2/3 of the sales expectations.-25:The financial department has calculated that Vitfit would give 1.5 Euro profit per bottle.

This would save Teasies 10 million Euro of rent costs they had calculated for Vitfit's production.-23:Vitfit's final formula is still not patented because there are some legal conflicts. To finalize the patent process, Teasies would need to pay additional 5 million Euro of legal fees on top of the forecast. The patent is necessary; otherwise Vitfit would be immediately copied by competitors and become unprofitable.-24:Market research shows that consumers are not very enthusiastic about Vitfit.
