They sell at high prices but reach profit margins between 50 cents and 1 Euro per item.  2: Choo-Choo's biggest success so far has been ΓÇ£HarmonyΓÇ¥, a chewing gum with a lavender aroma. It was marketed with a wellness theme two years ago and generated a lot of positive press although it was a very simple idea. It sold out in record time.  3: Some managers find Cosmo Explosion too experimental for the moment as the company really needs fast money. Others think that the jelly idea could be the base for new products.  4: A few managers think that 30 map pieces in ΓÇ£Treasure islandΓÇ¥ are too many for collecting, but most believe that the prize toys are so attractive and the collecting activity is so much fun that the gums will sell out in no time.  5: A part of the management team thinks that Whitey is not quite innovative enough for Choo-Choo's image. Others think that the formula is very unique and will attract many customers.  6: The R&D department has developed two versions of ΓÇ£Cosmo ExplosionΓÇ¥: one carries the fruity jelly as one big core, in the other the jelly is inserted in many tiny pearls.  7: Choo-Choo can easily produce Cosmo Explosion with one big jelly core. Any other version of Cosmo Explosion would cost additional 50 000 euro on top of the forecast for machinery changes.  8: Another company has just patented the production process of inserting tiny jelly pearls into chewing gum. Therefore, it is not legal to produce Cosmo explosion in this way. Choo-Choo has to choose a different way of putting the jelly into the gum.  9: According to market research people really like the jelly in Cosmo Explosion, unless they bite on a big chunk of it. A gum with tiny jelly pearls would sell 100% as expected, a gum with a jelly core only 50%.  10: The financial department has calculated that Cosmo Explosion would bring home 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.  11: For Zen the R&D department has very easily adapted the formula they used for Harmony. A new key ingredient is magnesium which has a relaxing effect.  12: Choo-Choo needs magnesium for the production of Zen. Because a new source of magnesium was just found, prices for it have fallen. Choo-Choo would pay 50 000 Euro less for this ingredient than expected.  13: Choo-Choo could avoid competition for Zen if it gets a patent for the new formula. But it would cost additional 100 000 Euro in legal fees on top of the forecast.  14: Market research has shown that Zen would make 100% of the predicted sales if it was the only gum of this kind on the market. But there is a competitor planning to launch the very same kind of gum at the same time. This would cut the sales to 50%.  15: The financial department has calculated that Zen would make 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  16: The R&D department has proposed a standard, well-tested formula for Treasure Island.  17: As Choo-Choo only produces gum, they have to buy the prize toys elsewhere. They have found a supplier who can sell them max. 1000 toys at 50 Euro per toy.  18: According to law, Choo-Choo must guarantee that every child who sends in a completed Treasure Island map indeed gets the exact same toy that is shown in the promotion. Breaking this law would cause severe bad press and might ruin the company.  19: Market research shows that kids love the map collecting. Treasure Island would sell 100% as expected. As the kids will use online social networks to exchange map pieces, it is sure that between 1500 and 2000 maps will be completed and sent in for a prize toy.  20: The financial department has calculated that Treasure Island would make 1.25 Euro profit per item and expects sales of 400 000 items. This calculation does not include the cost of the prize toys though.  21: The R&D department has come up with a very innovative formula for Whitey. It uses soft granules in the gum for a mechanical whitening effect and does not contain any chemical whiteners.  22: Whitening chemicals that are usually contained in whitening gums can cause damage on the machines. Taking care of it would cost additional 50 000 Euro.  23: The government has set up a new initiative to support innovation. But only innovations that are actually brought into production can get it. Whitey's formula is very innovative. If it is put on the market, Choo-Choo would get an innovation award and a prize of 100 000 Euro.  24: According to market research, Whitey would make 100% of the predicted sales.  25: The financial department has calculated that Whitey would make 0.50 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  26: The R&D department has developed a formula with an extra-long freshness effect for Business Class. It works, but they have not done extensive testing series because that would cost 100 000 Euro extra.  27: Choo-Choo can use existing production facilities for Business class, which makes it very simple.  28: According to law, if Choo-Choo wants to promote Business Class by saying that it has an extra-long freshness effect, they first have to show results of an extensive testing series. Otherwise they cannot use this claim for promoting sales.  29: Market research shows that the extra-long freshness effect of Business Class brings sales up to 150% of the expectation. But for this, the gums have to be sold with this claim; otherwise it will not sell at all.  30: The financial department has calculated that Business Class would make 0.50 Euro profit per item.

Any and all newline or tab characters must be denoted by '---' and '--' respectively. Info Items:1: Choo-Choo's strategy is to make a big profit per item. They sell at high prices but reach profit margins between 50 cents and 1 Euro per item.  2: Choo-Choo's biggest success so far has been ΓÇ£HarmonyΓÇ¥, a chewing gum with a lavender aroma. It was marketed with a wellness theme two years ago and generated a lot of positive press although it was a very simple idea. It sold out in record time.  3: Some managers find Cosmo Explosion too experimental for the moment as the company really needs fast money. Others think that the jelly idea could be the base for new products.  4: A few managers think that 30 map pieces in ΓÇ£Treasure islandΓÇ¥ are too many for collecting, but most believe that the prize toys are so attractive and the collecting activity is so much fun that the gums will sell out in no time.  5: A part of the management team thinks that Whitey is not quite innovative enough for Choo-Choo's image. Others think that the formula is very unique and will attract many customers.  6: The R&D department has developed two versions of ΓÇ£Cosmo ExplosionΓÇ¥: one carries the fruity jelly as one big core, in the other the jelly is inserted in many tiny pearls.  7: Choo-Choo can easily produce Cosmo Explosion with one big jelly core. Any other version of Cosmo Explosion would cost additional 50 000 euro on top of the forecast for machinery changes.  8: Another company has just patented the production process of inserting tiny jelly pearls into chewing gum. Therefore, it is not legal to produce Cosmo explosion in this way. Choo-Choo has to choose a different way of putting the jelly into the gum.  9: According to market research people really like the jelly in Cosmo Explosion, unless they bite on a big chunk of it. A gum with tiny jelly pearls would sell 100% as expected, a gum with a jelly core only 50%.  10: The financial department has calculated that Cosmo Explosion would bring home 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.  11: For Zen the R&D department has very easily adapted the formula they used for Harmony. A new key ingredient is magnesium which has a relaxing effect.  12: Choo-Choo needs magnesium for the production of Zen. Because a new source of magnesium was just found, prices for it have fallen. Choo-Choo would pay 50 000 Euro less for this ingredient than expected.  13: Choo-Choo could avoid competition for Zen if it gets a patent for the new formula. But it would cost additional 100 000 Euro in legal fees on top of the forecast.  14: Market research has shown that Zen would make 100% of the predicted sales if it was the only gum of this kind on the market. But there is a competitor planning to launch the very same kind of gum at the same time. This would cut the sales to 50%.  15: The financial department has calculated that Zen would make 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  16: The R&D department has proposed a standard, well-tested formula for Treasure Island.  17: As Choo-Choo only produces gum, they have to buy the prize toys elsewhere. They have found a supplier who can sell them max. 1000 toys at 50 Euro per toy.  18: According to law, Choo-Choo must guarantee that every child who sends in a completed Treasure Island map indeed gets the exact same toy that is shown in the promotion. Breaking this law would cause severe bad press and might ruin the company.  19: Market research shows that kids love the map collecting. Treasure Island would sell 100% as expected. As the kids will use online social networks to exchange map pieces, it is sure that between 1500 and 2000 maps will be completed and sent in for a prize toy.  20: The financial department has calculated that Treasure Island would make 1.25 Euro profit per item and expects sales of 400 000 items. This calculation does not include the cost of the prize toys though.  21: The R&D department has come up with a very innovative formula for Whitey. It uses soft granules in the gum for a mechanical whitening effect and does not contain any chemical whiteners.  22: Whitening chemicals that are usually contained in whitening gums can cause damage on the machines. Taking care of it would cost additional 50 000 Euro.  23: The government has set up a new initiative to support innovation. But only innovations that are actually brought into production can get it.

It was marketed with a wellness theme two years ago and generated a lot of positive press although it was a very simple idea. It sold out in record time.  3: Some managers find Cosmo Explosion too experimental for the moment as the company really needs fast money. Others think that the jelly idea could be the base for new products.  4: A few managers think that 30 map pieces in ΓÇ£Treasure islandΓÇ¥ are too many for collecting, but most believe that the prize toys are so attractive and the collecting activity is so much fun that the gums will sell out in no time.  5: A part of the management team thinks that Whitey is not quite innovative enough for Choo-Choo's image. Others think that the formula is very unique and will attract many customers.  6: The R&D department has developed two versions of ΓÇ£Cosmo ExplosionΓÇ¥: one carries the fruity jelly as one big core, in the other the jelly is inserted in many tiny pearls.  7: Choo-Choo can easily produce Cosmo Explosion with one big jelly core. Any other version of Cosmo Explosion would cost additional 50 000 euro on top of the forecast for machinery changes.  8: Another company has just patented the production process of inserting tiny jelly pearls into chewing gum. Therefore, it is not legal to produce Cosmo explosion in this way. Choo-Choo has to choose a different way of putting the jelly into the gum.  9: According to market research people really like the jelly in Cosmo Explosion, unless they bite on a big chunk of it. A gum with tiny jelly pearls would sell 100% as expected, a gum with a jelly core only 50%.  10: The financial department has calculated that Cosmo Explosion would bring home 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.  11: For Zen the R&D department has very easily adapted the formula they used for Harmony. A new key ingredient is magnesium which has a relaxing effect.  12: Choo-Choo needs magnesium for the production of Zen. Because a new source of magnesium was just found, prices for it have fallen. Choo-Choo would pay 50 000 Euro less for this ingredient than expected.  13: Choo-Choo could avoid competition for Zen if it gets a patent for the new formula. But it would cost additional 100 000 Euro in legal fees on top of the forecast.  14: Market research has shown that Zen would make 100% of the predicted sales if it was the only gum of this kind on the market. But there is a competitor planning to launch the very same kind of gum at the same time. This would cut the sales to 50%.  15: The financial department has calculated that Zen would make 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  16: The R&D department has proposed a standard, well-tested formula for Treasure Island.  17: As Choo-Choo only produces gum, they have to buy the prize toys elsewhere. They have found a supplier who can sell them max. 1000 toys at 50 Euro per toy.  18: According to law, Choo-Choo must guarantee that every child who sends in a completed Treasure Island map indeed gets the exact same toy that is shown in the promotion. Breaking this law would cause severe bad press and might ruin the company.  19: Market research shows that kids love the map collecting. Treasure Island would sell 100% as expected. As the kids will use online social networks to exchange map pieces, it is sure that between 1500 and 2000 maps will be completed and sent in for a prize toy.  20: The financial department has calculated that Treasure Island would make 1.25 Euro profit per item and expects sales of 400 000 items. This calculation does not include the cost of the prize toys though.  21: The R&D department has come up with a very innovative formula for Whitey. It uses soft granules in the gum for a mechanical whitening effect and does not contain any chemical whiteners.  22: Whitening chemicals that are usually contained in whitening gums can cause damage on the machines. Taking care of it would cost additional 50 000 Euro.  23: The government has set up a new initiative to support innovation. But only innovations that are actually brought into production can get it. Whitey's formula is very innovative. If it is put on the market, Choo-Choo would get an innovation award and a prize of 100 000 Euro.  24: According to market research, Whitey would make 100% of the predicted sales.  25: The financial department has calculated that Whitey would make 0.50 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  26: The R&D department has developed a formula with an extra-long freshness effect for Business Class. It works, but they have not done extensive testing series because that would cost 100 000 Euro extra.  27: Choo-Choo can use existing production facilities for Business class, which makes it very simple.  28: According to law, if Choo-Choo wants to promote Business Class by saying that it has an extra-long freshness effect, they first have to show results of an extensive testing series. Otherwise they cannot use this claim for promoting sales.  29: Market research shows that the extra-long freshness effect of Business Class brings sales up to 150% of the expectation. But for this, the gums have to be sold with this claim; otherwise it will not sell at all.  30: The financial department has calculated that Business Class would make 0.50 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.

If you are not sure that the sentence does not match any of the info items, categorize it as Partial. Please do not include any newline or tab characters. Any and all newline or tab characters must be denoted by '---' and '--' respectively. Info Items:1: Choo-Choo's strategy is to make a big profit per item. They sell at high prices but reach profit margins between 50 cents and 1 Euro per item.  2: Choo-Choo's biggest success so far has been ΓÇ£HarmonyΓÇ¥, a chewing gum with a lavender aroma. It was marketed with a wellness theme two years ago and generated a lot of positive press although it was a very simple idea. It sold out in record time.  3: Some managers find Cosmo Explosion too experimental for the moment as the company really needs fast money. Others think that the jelly idea could be the base for new products.  4: A few managers think that 30 map pieces in ΓÇ£Treasure islandΓÇ¥ are too many for collecting, but most believe that the prize toys are so attractive and the collecting activity is so much fun that the gums will sell out in no time.  5: A part of the management team thinks that Whitey is not quite innovative enough for Choo-Choo's image. Others think that the formula is very unique and will attract many customers.  6: The R&D department has developed two versions of ΓÇ£Cosmo ExplosionΓÇ¥: one carries the fruity jelly as one big core, in the other the jelly is inserted in many tiny pearls.  7: Choo-Choo can easily produce Cosmo Explosion with one big jelly core. Any other version of Cosmo Explosion would cost additional 50 000 euro on top of the forecast for machinery changes.  8: Another company has just patented the production process of inserting tiny jelly pearls into chewing gum. Therefore, it is not legal to produce Cosmo explosion in this way. Choo-Choo has to choose a different way of putting the jelly into the gum.  9: According to market research people really like the jelly in Cosmo Explosion, unless they bite on a big chunk of it. A gum with tiny jelly pearls would sell 100% as expected, a gum with a jelly core only 50%.  10: The financial department has calculated that Cosmo Explosion would bring home 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.  11: For Zen the R&D department has very easily adapted the formula they used for Harmony. A new key ingredient is magnesium which has a relaxing effect.  12: Choo-Choo needs magnesium for the production of Zen. Because a new source of magnesium was just found, prices for it have fallen. Choo-Choo would pay 50 000 Euro less for this ingredient than expected.  13: Choo-Choo could avoid competition for Zen if it gets a patent for the new formula. But it would cost additional 100 000 Euro in legal fees on top of the forecast.  14: Market research has shown that Zen would make 100% of the predicted sales if it was the only gum of this kind on the market. But there is a competitor planning to launch the very same kind of gum at the same time. This would cut the sales to 50%.  15: The financial department has calculated that Zen would make 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  16: The R&D department has proposed a standard, well-tested formula for Treasure Island.  17: As Choo-Choo only produces gum, they have to buy the prize toys elsewhere. They have found a supplier who can sell them max. 1000 toys at 50 Euro per toy.  18: According to law, Choo-Choo must guarantee that every child who sends in a completed Treasure Island map indeed gets the exact same toy that is shown in the promotion. Breaking this law would cause severe bad press and might ruin the company.  19: Market research shows that kids love the map collecting. Treasure Island would sell 100% as expected. As the kids will use online social networks to exchange map pieces, it is sure that between 1500 and 2000 maps will be completed and sent in for a prize toy.  20: The financial department has calculated that Treasure Island would make 1.25 Euro profit per item and expects sales of 400 000 items. This calculation does not include the cost of the prize toys though.  21: The R&D department has come up with a very innovative formula for Whitey. It uses soft granules in the gum for a mechanical whitening effect and does not contain any chemical whiteners.  22: Whitening chemicals that are usually contained in whitening gums can cause damage on the machines. Taking care of it would cost additional 50 000 Euro.  23: The government has set up a new initiative to support innovation. But only innovations that are actually brought into production can get it. Whitey's formula is very innovative. If it is put on the market, Choo-Choo would get an innovation award and a prize of 100 000 Euro.  24: According to market research, Whitey would make 100% of the predicted sales.  25: The financial department has calculated that Whitey would make 0.50 Euro profit per item.

It was marketed with a wellness theme two years ago and generated a lot of positive press although it was a very simple idea. It sold out in record time.  3: Some managers find Cosmo Explosion too experimental for the moment as the company really needs fast money. Others think that the jelly idea could be the base for new products.  4: A few managers think that 30 map pieces in ΓÇ£Treasure islandΓÇ¥ are too many for collecting, but most believe that the prize toys are so attractive and the collecting activity is so much fun that the gums will sell out in no time.  5: A part of the management team thinks that Whitey is not quite innovative enough for Choo-Choo's image. Others think that the formula is very unique and will attract many customers.  6: The R&D department has developed two versions of ΓÇ£Cosmo ExplosionΓÇ¥: one carries the fruity jelly as one big core, in the other the jelly is inserted in many tiny pearls.  7: Choo-Choo can easily produce Cosmo Explosion with one big jelly core. Any other version of Cosmo Explosion would cost additional 50 000 euro on top of the forecast for machinery changes.  8: Another company has just patented the production process of inserting tiny jelly pearls into chewing gum. Therefore, it is not legal to produce Cosmo explosion in this way. Choo-Choo has to choose a different way of putting the jelly into the gum.  9: According to market research people really like the jelly in Cosmo Explosion, unless they bite on a big chunk of it. A gum with tiny jelly pearls would sell 100% as expected, a gum with a jelly core only 50%.  10: The financial department has calculated that Cosmo Explosion would bring home 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.  11: For Zen the R&D department has very easily adapted the formula they used for Harmony. A new key ingredient is magnesium which has a relaxing effect.  12: Choo-Choo needs magnesium for the production of Zen. Because a new source of magnesium was just found, prices for it have fallen. Choo-Choo would pay 50 000 Euro less for this ingredient than expected.  13: Choo-Choo could avoid competition for Zen if it gets a patent for the new formula. But it would cost additional 100 000 Euro in legal fees on top of the forecast.  14: Market research has shown that Zen would make 100% of the predicted sales if it was the only gum of this kind on the market. But there is a competitor planning to launch the very same kind of gum at the same time. This would cut the sales to 50%.  15: The financial department has calculated that Zen would make 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  16: The R&D department has proposed a standard, well-tested formula for Treasure Island.  17: As Choo-Choo only produces gum, they have to buy the prize toys elsewhere. They have found a supplier who can sell them max. 1000 toys at 50 Euro per toy.  18: According to law, Choo-Choo must guarantee that every child who sends in a completed Treasure Island map indeed gets the exact same toy that is shown in the promotion. Breaking this law would cause severe bad press and might ruin the company.  19: Market research shows that kids love the map collecting. Treasure Island would sell 100% as expected. As the kids will use online social networks to exchange map pieces, it is sure that between 1500 and 2000 maps will be completed and sent in for a prize toy.  20: The financial department has calculated that Treasure Island would make 1.25 Euro profit per item and expects sales of 400 000 items. This calculation does not include the cost of the prize toys though.  21: The R&D department has come up with a very innovative formula for Whitey. It uses soft granules in the gum for a mechanical whitening effect and does not contain any chemical whiteners.  22: Whitening chemicals that are usually contained in whitening gums can cause damage on the machines. Taking care of it would cost additional 50 000 Euro.  23: The government has set up a new initiative to support innovation. But only innovations that are actually brought into production can get it. Whitey's formula is very innovative. If it is put on the market, Choo-Choo would get an innovation award and a prize of 100 000 Euro.  24: According to market research, Whitey would make 100% of the predicted sales.  25: The financial department has calculated that Whitey would make 0.50 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  26: The R&D department has developed a formula with an extra-long freshness effect for Business Class. It works, but they have not done extensive testing series because that would cost 100 000 Euro extra.  27: Choo-Choo can use existing production facilities for Business class, which makes it very simple.  28: According to law, if Choo-Choo wants to promote Business Class by saying that it has an extra-long freshness effect, they first have to show results of an extensive testing series. Otherwise they cannot use this claim for promoting sales.  29: Market research shows that the extra-long freshness effect of Business Class brings sales up to 150% of the expectation. But for this, the gums have to be sold with this claim; otherwise it will not sell at all.  30: The financial department has calculated that Business Class would make 0.50 Euro profit per item.

It works, but they have not done extensive testing series because that would cost 100 000 Euro extra.  27: Choo-Choo can use existing production facilities for Business class, which makes it very simple.  28: According to law, if Choo-Choo wants to promote Business Class by saying that it has an extra-long freshness effect, they first have to show results of an extensive testing series. Otherwise they cannot use this claim for promoting sales.  29: Market research shows that the extra-long freshness effect of Business Class brings sales up to 150% of the expectation. But for this, the gums have to be sold with this claim; otherwise it will not sell at all.  30: The financial department has calculated that Business Class would make 0.50 Euro profit per item.

{"role":"system","content":"Your job is to associate the provided sentences with the info items (at most 3 info items per sentence). You must be very strict with your categorization and ONLY categorize the sentence if it is a confident match. If you are not sure that the sentence does not match any of the info items, categorize it as Partial. Please do not include any newline or tab characters. Any and all newline or tab characters must be denoted by '---' and '--' respectively. Info Items:1: Choo-Choo's strategy is to make a big profit per item. They sell at high prices but reach profit margins between 50 cents and 1 Euro per item.  2: Choo-Choo's biggest success so far has been ΓÇ£HarmonyΓÇ¥, a chewing gum with a lavender aroma. It was marketed with a wellness theme two years ago and generated a lot of positive press although it was a very simple idea. It sold out in record time.  3: Some managers find Cosmo Explosion too experimental for the moment as the company really needs fast money. Others think that the jelly idea could be the base for new products.  4: A few managers think that 30 map pieces in ΓÇ£Treasure islandΓÇ¥ are too many for collecting, but most believe that the prize toys are so attractive and the collecting activity is so much fun that the gums will sell out in no time.  5: A part of the management team thinks that Whitey is not quite innovative enough for Choo-Choo's image. Others think that the formula is very unique and will attract many customers.  6: The R&D department has developed two versions of ΓÇ£Cosmo ExplosionΓÇ¥: one carries the fruity jelly as one big core, in the other the jelly is inserted in many tiny pearls.  7: Choo-Choo can easily produce Cosmo Explosion with one big jelly core. Any other version of Cosmo Explosion would cost additional 50 000 euro on top of the forecast for machinery changes.  8: Another company has just patented the production process of inserting tiny jelly pearls into chewing gum. Therefore, it is not legal to produce Cosmo explosion in this way. Choo-Choo has to choose a different way of putting the jelly into the gum.  9: According to market research people really like the jelly in Cosmo Explosion, unless they bite on a big chunk of it. A gum with tiny jelly pearls would sell 100% as expected, a gum with a jelly core only 50%.  10: The financial department has calculated that Cosmo Explosion would bring home 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.  11: For Zen the R&D department has very easily adapted the formula they used for Harmony. A new key ingredient is magnesium which has a relaxing effect.  12: Choo-Choo needs magnesium for the production of Zen. Because a new source of magnesium was just found, prices for it have fallen. Choo-Choo would pay 50 000 Euro less for this ingredient than expected.  13: Choo-Choo could avoid competition for Zen if it gets a patent for the new formula. But it would cost additional 100 000 Euro in legal fees on top of the forecast.  14: Market research has shown that Zen would make 100% of the predicted sales if it was the only gum of this kind on the market. But there is a competitor planning to launch the very same kind of gum at the same time. This would cut the sales to 50%.  15: The financial department has calculated that Zen would make 0.75 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  16: The R&D department has proposed a standard, well-tested formula for Treasure Island.  17: As Choo-Choo only produces gum, they have to buy the prize toys elsewhere. They have found a supplier who can sell them max. 1000 toys at 50 Euro per toy.  18: According to law, Choo-Choo must guarantee that every child who sends in a completed Treasure Island map indeed gets the exact same toy that is shown in the promotion. Breaking this law would cause severe bad press and might ruin the company.  19: Market research shows that kids love the map collecting. Treasure Island would sell 100% as expected. As the kids will use online social networks to exchange map pieces, it is sure that between 1500 and 2000 maps will be completed and sent in for a prize toy.  20: The financial department has calculated that Treasure Island would make 1.25 Euro profit per item and expects sales of 400 000 items. This calculation does not include the cost of the prize toys though.  21: The R&D department has come up with a very innovative formula for Whitey. It uses soft granules in the gum for a mechanical whitening effect and does not contain any chemical whiteners.  22: Whitening chemicals that are usually contained in whitening gums can cause damage on the machines. Taking care of it would cost additional 50 000 Euro.  23: The government has set up a new initiative to support innovation. But only innovations that are actually brought into production can get it. Whitey's formula is very innovative. If it is put on the market, Choo-Choo would get an innovation award and a prize of 100 000 Euro.  24: According to market research, Whitey would make 100% of the predicted sales.  25: The financial department has calculated that Whitey would make 0.50 Euro profit per item. They expect to sell 400 000 items.  26: The R&D department has developed a formula with an extra-long freshness effect for Business Class. It works, but they have not done extensive testing series because that would cost 100 000 Euro extra.  27: Choo-Choo can use existing production facilities for Business class, which makes it very simple.  28: According to law, if Choo-Choo wants to promote Business Class by saying that it has an extra-long freshness effect, they first have to show results of an extensive testing series. Otherwise they cannot use this claim for promoting sales.  29: Market research shows that the extra-long freshness effect of Business Class brings sales up to 150% of the expectation. But for this, the gums have to be sold with this claim; otherwise it will not sell at all.  30: The financial department has calculated that Business Class would make 0.50 Euro profit per item. They expect sales of 400 000 items.
