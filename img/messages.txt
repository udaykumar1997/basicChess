I think the market for that one is much smaller and profit margins will be smaller too\n606 - I think that, even with the government incentive for bioberry, vitfit is still more profitable, despite the expenses with the patent\n609 - The expenses for Vitfit are small, and we save 10 million on rent since space freed up for production.\n611 - But vitfit would be the option for athletes, Bioberry is for the entire population\n614 - I think the price point is too high to actually appeal to the entire population.

Acqua di Roma, Teasie's Lemon Ice Tea and Vitfit\n645 - aqua di roma had a little problem, so i would rank it last. What do you think?\n646 - The 5 million euro in legal fees?\n648 - Acqua di Roma is expected to sell 50 million bottles, at 1.5 eur per profit. That's 75 million. If we take 5m out, it's still 70 million\n649 - That's the second most profitable, not BioBerry\n650 - lemon iced tea will make 50 millon in 2 years\n652 - So we got 1. Electric Grape 2.

Teasiers4. DiRoma5. Electric Grape\n973 - Leon Iced Tea" in my opinion is a jump on nostalgia. It won't accept. There are many products that go back to their roots\n974 - Perhaps there could be variations between the second and third places\n975 - Do you think Diroma would be better than the re-released Tiesers?\n976 - That's the one I'm most unsure about, I hope we're not underestimating the original iced tea revisit\n977 - Personally I'm not convinced by Acqua di Roma, especially if they will only be able to produce it for two years, and I'd leave it second to last\n978 - I like the order: 1. Vitfit, BioBerry, Acqua di Roma (catchy name), Lemon Iced Tea, Electric Grape\n979 - I agree on the Roma, and also - making the nostalgic tea will be like reinventing the wheel, there's plenty of tea drinks already, what could you do to make it special\n980 - I mean, I recognize I have limited information to have an informed opinion about the Acqua di Roma thing, because products like that simply don't exist in Italy, literally no one would buy them\n981 - I'd stick with Vitfit being first despite this info^\n983 - That order sounds good too, because a relaunch may only be a good idea for the first few months and then people will forget about it.\n"}
